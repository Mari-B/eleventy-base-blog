#My Eleventy Blog

This is a blog that I've created using the static site generator Eleventy (which uses Nunjucks and md to output html files).
It's connected to and hosted on Netlify at this address: https://eloquent-brown-727c24.netlify.app/
andf it's also configured with the Netlify CMS which can be accessed at https://eloquent-brown-727c24.netlify.app/admin
this allows me to create blog posts through a more user friendly interface also being able to add a picture and a blog post rating.
