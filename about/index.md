A little bit about myself
</h1>

<p>
With a background in translation, I am a dynamic professional who took part in the Skyâ€™s software development bootcamp and is looking to start a career in tech. My varied expertise allows me to work well in a team, communicate effectively, deliver results when working under pressure and towards tight deadlines. Thanks to my freelance experience, I can work autonomously, stay motivated and I constantly look forward to learning new things and improving myself. I am also an analytical and logical thinker with an eye for detail.
